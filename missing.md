# Missing Strings

## In General

Some of the localization strings are automatically capitalized in the UI. In some languages (like German) it would be wrong to do this.

*It may be a lack of localization in the code, as some of the stings are actually in the JSON files. Some of the strings may also be case sensitive.

### Timesheet

The abbreviations of the days of the week in German have only two characters. I don't know about other languages, but you might want to consider setting separate localization strings for abbreviated weekdays.

### Overview

The string "open" has two meanings in this application:

1. "Ã¶ffnen" as a verb, like "open something".
2. "offen" as an adjective like "an outstanding bill or task".

For the translation I suggest to use the single "open" only as an adjective like in "open tasks" in the project overview. If you use "open" as a verb, you should define what the user will open, like "open file". I didn't changed the translation yet.

The month translation is missing in the chart.
